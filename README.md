# Cricket DataViz
Data visualization projects using cricket statistics. The focus is to produce interactive visualizations along with storytelling.

**Data Collection** <br />
The data collection is done through web scrapping using Selenium. The target URL is first pasted in 'URL for data.txt'. The 'Data Scraper.py' will take the URL to collect and store the data in a CSV file. 

**Present focus** <br />
To improve the scraper (and tracker) program to be more general and flexible to handle requests for other types of data sets/queries.
